			 <h1>About Me</h1>
			     <p>Hello, my name is Joseph De La Portilla, I am a sophomore from Pasadena High School thats in The App Academy. The App Academy
                    is a four year program, that starts from when you fist enter high school, til you graduate high school. This is
                    currently my second year in The App Academy and I love it, I love learning about all these different
                    lines of code, commands, classes, id's, ect. too many to name.

                    I'm 15 years old play baseball, video games, love learning about code, and putting it in to play in
                    my own customizable way. I play baseball here at Pasadena High and it's fun and a good workout. I've
                    been playing baseball since I was 5 and I never had had this much excersize in my life. Ever since I
                    heard about The App Academy I wanted to join as soon as I got the chance to.The App Academy has quite a bit
                    of perks, from getting to go during school days to go see people code for work, to getting to go to
                    Microsoft and be part of a Hack-a-Thon. It's the best class of the day(by far) and everything about it 
                    is just great. When I get older I hope to be able to code for a living and making a great life out of it.
                    To help shape the future, just like all of the great teachers I've had, a big thank you to them for helping
                    me so much. This website I'm making right now you're reading this on, would not have been possible...without
                    The App Academy.
            </p>
